# JME Example
This is a simple example of JMonkey engine for IntelliJ (and android studio) the build is done with Gradle, the app work on Desktop, Android, Ios and Vr at the same time thanks to Gradle multi-project so you don't need to do tow projects (one for Android and the other for the desktop) for one game.
